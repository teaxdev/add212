Classes augment the DRY principle, which ensure you repeat yourself as little as possible.

Controllers also greatly improve how concise your code is, and help with DRY by using methods in the controller instead of having to switch pages. Single entry points also promote DRY, having index.php as the only page handling requests helps out.

visibility modifiers are extremely important for managing data thats sensitive, ensuring only developers can access it.
